# Portfolio Analysis

One of the main issues of being investor is how to track your securities. 

Some investors use apps from their brokers, others prefer third parties sites.

The truth is all of them are terrible. They do not give sufficient info about portfolio, but just weights and basic graph.

Surfing internet I came to idea to create if not an app but script to facilitate portfolio tracking.

Week by week, this repository will be filled with more advanced script.

Current section scripts require quantmod and timeSeries packages.
